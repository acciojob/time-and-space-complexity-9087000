	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a way to analyze how efficient an algorithm is. It allows us to estimate how much time an algorithm takes to complete based on its input size. The more efficient an algorithm is, the lower the time complexity.</p>
	<p>Space complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as the input size grows. Typically, algorithms that use less memory are considered more efficient. <b>Space Complexity</b> is often expressed as O(n), where n is the input size.</p>
